[**OpenAlex**](https://openalex.org) is a fully open catalog of the global research system. It's named after the [ancient Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) and made by the nonprofit [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/).

This is the **technical documentation for OpenAlex,** including the [**OpenAlex API**](how-to-use-the-api/api-overview.md) and the [**data snapshot**](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot)**.** Here, you can learn how to set up your code to access OpenAlex's data. If you want to explore the data as a human, you may be more interested in [**OpenAlex Web**](https://help.openalex.org)**.**

## Data

The OpenAlex dataset describes scholarly [_entities_ ](api-entities/entities-overview.md)and how those entities are connected to each other. Types of entities include [works](api-entities/works/), [authors](api-entities/authors/), [sources](api-entities/sources/), [institutions](api-entities/institutions/), [topics](api-entities/topics/), [publishers](api-entities/publishers/), and [funders](api-entities/funders/).

Together, these make a huge web (or more technically, heterogeneous directed [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)) of hundreds of millions of entities and billions of connections between them all.

The API has a limit of 100,000 calls per day, and the snapshot is updated monthly. If you need a higher limit, or more frequent updates, please look into [**OpenAlex Premium.**](https://openalex.org/pricing)

The web interface for OpenAlex, built directly on top of the API, is the quickest and easiest way to [get started with OpenAlex](https://help.openalex.org/getting-started).

## Why OpenAlex?

OpenAlex offers an open replacement for industry-standard scientific knowledge bases like Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science. [Compared to](https://openalex.org/about#comparison) these paywalled services, OpenAlex offers significant advantages in terms of inclusivity, affordability, and avaliability.

OpenAlex is:

* _Big —_ We have about twice the coverage of the other services, and have significantly better coverage of non-English works and works from the Global South.
* _Easy —_ Our service is fast, modern, and well-documented.
* _Open —_ Our complete dataset is free under the CC0 license, which allows for transparency and reuse.
