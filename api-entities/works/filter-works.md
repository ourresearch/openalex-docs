# Filter works

It's easy to filter works with the `filter` parameter:

* Get works where the publication year is 2020\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=publication\_year:2020`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=publication\_year:2020)

In this example the filter is `publication_year` and the value is 2020.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's best to [read about filters](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/filter-entity-lists.md) before trying these out. It will show you how to combine filters and build an AND, OR, or negation query.
{% endhint %}

## `/works` attribute filters

You can filter using these attributes of the [`Work`](work-object/) object (click each one to view their documentation on the `Work` object page):

{% hint style="danger" %}
The `host_venue` and `alternate_host_venues` properties have been deprecated in favor of [`primary_location`](work-object/#primary\_location) and [`locations`](work-object/#locations). The attributes `host_venue` and `alternate_host_venues` are no longer available in the Work object, and trying to access them in filters or group-bys will return an error.

Want to filter by the `display_name` of an associated entity (author, institution, source, etc.)? [See here.](search-works.md#why-cant-i-search-by-name-of-related-entity-author-name-institution-name-etc.)
{% endhint %}

## `/works` convenience filters

These filters aren't attributes of the [`Work`](work-object/) object, but they're handy for solving some common use cases:

#### `abstract.search`

Text search using abstracts

Value: a search string

Returns: works whose abstract includes the given string. See the [search page](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/search-entities.md) for details on the search algorithm used.

* Get works with abstracts that mention "artificial intelligence": [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=abstract.search:artificial%20intelligence`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=abstract.search:artificial%20intelligence)

#### `authors_count`

Number of authors for a work

Value: an Integer

Returns: works with the chosen number of [`authorships`](work-object/#authorships) objects (authors). You can use the inequality filter to select a range, such as `authors_count:>5`_._

* Get works that have exactly one author\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authors\_count:1`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authors\_count:1)

#### `authorships.institutions.continent` (alias: `institutions.continent`)

Value: a String with a valid [continent filter](../geo/continents.md#filter-by-continent)

Returns: works where at least _one_ of the author's institutions is in the chosen continent.

* Get works where at least one author's institution in each work is located in Europe\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.continent:europe`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.continent:europe)

#### `authorships.institutions.is_global_south` (alias: `institutions.is_global_south`)

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works where at least _one_ of the author's institutions is in the Global South ([read more](../geo/regions.md#global-south)).

* Get works where at least one author's institution is in the Global South\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.is\_global\_south:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.is\_global\_south:true)

#### `best_open_version`

Value: a String with one of the following values:

* **`any`**: This means that `best_oa_location.version` = `submittedVersion`, `acceptedVersion`, or `publishedVersion`
* **`acceptedOrPublished`**: This means that `best_oa_location.version` can be `acceptedVersion` or `publishedVersion`
* **`published`**: This means that `best_oa_location.version` = `publishedVersion`

Returns: works that meet the above criteria for [`best_oa_location`](work-object/#best\_oa\_location).

* Get works whose `best_oa_location` is a submitted, accepted, or published version: [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=best_open_version:any`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=best\_open\_version:any)\`\`

#### `cited_by`

Value: the [OpenAlex ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/#the-openalex-id) for a given work

Returns: works found in the given work's [`referenced_works`](work-object/#referenced\_works) section. You can think of this as **outgoing citations**.

* Get works cited by [`https://openalex.org/W2766808518`](https://openalex.org/W2766808518):\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cited_by:W2766808518`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cited\_by:W2766808518)

#### `cites`

Value: the [OpenAlex ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/#the-openalex-id) for a given work

Returns: works that cite the given work. This is works that have the given OpenAlex ID in the [`referenced_works`](work-object/#referenced\_works) section. You can think of this as **incoming citations**.

* Get works that cite [`https://openalex.org/W2741809807`](https://openalex.org/W2741809807): [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2741809807`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2741809807)\`\`

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of results returned by this filter may be slightly higher than the work's[`cited_by_count`](work-object/#cited\_by\_count)due to a timing lag in updating that field.
{% endhint %}

#### `concepts_count`

Value: an Integer

Returns: works with the chosen number of [`concepts`](work-object/#concepts).

* Get works with at least three concepts assigned\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=concepts\_count:>2`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=concepts\_count:%3E2)

#### `default.search`

Text search across titles, abstracts, and full text of works

Value: a search string

This works the same as using the [`search` parameter](search-works.md#search-works) for Works.

#### `display_name.search` (alias: `title.search`)

Text search across titles for works

Value: a search string

Returns: works whose[`display_name`](work-object/#display\_name) (title) includes the given string; see the [search page](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/search-entities.md) for details.

* Get works with titles that mention the word "wombat":\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:wombat`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:wombat)

{% hint style="info" %}
For most cases, you should use the [`search`](search-works.md#works-full-search) parameter instead of this filter, because it uses a better search algorithm and searches over abstracts as well as titles.
{% endhint %}

#### `from_created_date`

Value: a date, formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`

Returns: works with [`created_date`](work-object/#created\_date) greater than or equal to the given date.

This field requires an [OpenAlex Premium subscription to access. Click here to learn more.](https://openalex.org/pricing)

* Get works created on or _after_ January 12th, 2023 (does not work without valid API key):\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from_created_date:2023-01-12&api_key=myapikey`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from\_created\_date:2023-01-12\&api\_key=myapikey)\`\`

#### `from_publication_date`

Value: a date, formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`

Returns: works with [`publication_date`](work-object/#publication\_date) greater than or equal to the given date.

* Get works published on or _after_ March 14th, 2001:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from_publication_date:2001-03-14`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from\_publication\_date:2001-03-14)

{% hint style="info" %}
Filtering by publication date is not a reliable way to retrieve recently updated and created works, due to the way publishers assign publication dates. Use `from_created_date` or `from_updated_date` to get the latest changes in OpenAlex.
{% endhint %}

#### `from_updated_date`

Value: a date, formatted as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date or date-time string (for example: "2020-05-17", "2020-05-17T15:30", or "2020-01-02T00:22:35.180390").

Returns: works with [`updated_date`](work-object/#updated\_date) greater than or equal to the given date.

This field requires an [OpenAlex Premium subscription to access. Click here to learn more.](https://openalex.org/pricing)

* Get works updated on or _after_ January 12th, 2023 (does not work without valid API key):\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from_updated_date:2023-01-12&api_key=myapikey`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from\_updated\_date:2023-01-12\&api\_key=myapikey)

{% endhint %}

#### **`fulltext.search`**

Value: a search string

Returns: works whose fulltext includes the given string. Fulltext search is available for a subset of works, obtained either from PDFs or [n-grams](get-n-grams.md), see [`Work.has_fulltext`](work-object/#has\_fulltext) for more details.

* Get works with fulltext that mention "climate change": [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=fulltext.search:climate%20change`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=fulltext.search:climate%20change)

{% hint style="info" %}
We combined some n-grams before storing them in our search database, so querying for an exact phrase using quotes does not always work well.
{% endhint %}

#### `has_abstract`

Works that have an abstract available

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works that have or lack an abstract, depending on the given value.

* Get the works that have abstracts:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_abstract:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_abstract:true)

#### `has_doi`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works that have or lack a DOI, depending on the given value. It's especially useful for [grouping](group-works.md).

* Get the works that have no DOI assigned:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_doi:false`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_doi:false) \`\`

#### `has_oa_accepted_or_published_version`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works with at least one of the [`locations`](work-object/#locations) has [`is_oa`](work-object/location-object.md#is\_oa)= true and [`version`](work-object/#version) is acceptedVersion or publishedVersion. For Works that undergo peer review, like journal articles, this means there is a peer-reviewed OA copy somewhere. For some items, like books, a published version doesn't imply peer review, so they aren't quite synonymous.

* Get works with an OA accepted or published copy\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_oa_accepted_or_published_version:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_oa\_accepted\_or\_published\_version:true)

#### `has_oa_submitted_version`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works with at least one of the [`locations`](work-object/#locations) has [`is_oa`](work-object/location-object.md#is\_oa)= true and [`version`](work-object/#version) is submittedVersion. This is useful for finding works with preprints deposited somewhere.

* Get works with an OA submitted copy:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_oa_submitted_version:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_oa\_submitted\_version:true)\`\`

#### `has_orcid`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: if `true` it returns works where at least one author or has an [ORCID ID](work-object/#ids). If `false`, it returns works where no authors have an ORCID ID. This is based on the `orcid` field within [`authorships.author`](work-object/authorship-object.md#author). Note that, sometimes, we assign ORCID using [author disambiguation](../authors/author-disambiguation.md), so this does not necessarily mean that the work itself has ORCID information.

* Get the works where at least one author has an ORCID ID:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_orcid:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_orcid:true)&#x20;

#### `has_pmcid`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works that have or lack a PubMed Central identifier ([`pmcid`](work-object/#ids)) depending on the given value.

* Get the works that have a `pmcid`:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_pmcid:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_pmcid:true)\`\`

#### `has_pmid`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works that have or lack a PubMed identifier ([`pmid`](work-object/#ids)), depending on the given value.

#### `has_ngrams` (DEPRECATED)

Works that have n-grams available to enable full-text search in OpenAlex.

This filter has been deprecated. See instead: [`has_fulltext`](work-object/#has\_fulltext).

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works for which n-grams are available or unavailable, depending on the given value. N-grams power fulltext searches through the [`fulltext.search`](filter-works.md#fulltext.search) filter and the [`search`](search-works.md#works-full-search) parameter.

* Get the works that have n-grams:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_ngrams:true`](https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has\_ngrams:true)

#### `has_references`

Value: a Boolean (`true` or `false`)

Returns: works that have or lack [`referenced_works`](work-object/#referenced\_works), depending on the given value.
