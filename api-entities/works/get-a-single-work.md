# Get a single work

It's easy to get a work from from the API with: `/works/<entity_id>` Here's an example:

* Get the work with the [OpenAlex ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/#the-openalex-id) `W2741809807`: [`https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807`](https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807)``

That will return a [`Work`](work-object.md) object, describing everything OpenAlex knows about the work with that ID.

```json
{
    "id": "https://openalex.org/W2741809807",
    "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375",
    "title": "The state of OA: a large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles",
    "display_name": "The state of OA: a large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles",
    "publication_year": 2018,
    "publication_date": "2018-02-13",
    // other fields removed for brevity
}
```

You can make up to 50 of these queries at once by requesting a list of entities and filtering on IDs [using OR syntax](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/filter-entity-lists.md#addition-or) ([tutorial](https://blog.ourresearch.org/fetch-multiple-dois-in-one-openalex-api-request/)).
{% endhint %}

### External IDs

You can look up works using external IDs such as a DOI:

* Get the work with this DOI: `https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375`:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375](https://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375)

You can use the full ID or a shorter Uniform Resource Name (URN) format like so:

* Get the work with PubMed ID: `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14907713`:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/works/pmid:14907713](https://api.openalex.org/works/pmid:14907713)

Available external IDs for works are:

| External ID                    | URN     |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| DOI                            | `doi`   |
| Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) | `mag`   |
| PubMed ID (PMID)               | `pmid`  |
| PubMed Central ID (PMCID)      | `pmcid` |
