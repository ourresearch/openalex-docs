You can group authors with the `group_by` parameter:

* Get counts of authors by the last known institution continent:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/authors?group_by=last_known_institution.continent`](https://api.openalex.org/authors?group\_by=last\_known\_institution.continent)

Or you can group using one the attributes below.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's best to [read about group by](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-groups-of-entities.md) before trying these out. It will show you how results are formatted, the number of results returned, and how to sort results.
{% endhint %}
